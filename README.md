# CameraHandler
Here I am creating a class CameraHandler of type NSObject. 
In this I am using UIImagePickerControllerDelegate and UINavigationControllerDelegate for image picking from Camera and Photo Library .
I am also making an action sheet to choose from the both options. 
It is very simple to use and manage .
